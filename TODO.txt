* Thesaurus
* Combined lookup incorporating thesaurus
* all word lists are expected to be in ASCII but we use String (i.e. UTF-8) throughout
  so it would _probably_ be an optimisation to use bytes instead
* Wordle: need an easy way to say that a yellow character shouldn't be in a particular position
  (best idea so far is to be able to enter multiple "goes" where the user enters letters
  that were yellow, e.g. if I guessed "oaten" and the result was green "O" and yellow "T",
  the user could enter "-g O_t__" perhaps? (note upper/lower case)
* Wordle: might be an idea to order results by most common letters?
* (To think about) - maybe some way of marking off words tried in 'panagram' - perhaps
  an interface where the words disappear when selected? Curses?

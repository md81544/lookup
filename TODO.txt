* Investigate using more local loading of word lists to prevent huge collections being passed around, which slow down / make impossible usage of the debugger

* Allow -f with -r to find words in "in" clues... for example
  -v aldershotcafedemolition -f __/__c__ should return "de facto"

* List words found as substrings of -g or -r (and maybe a new option to find substring words in a long string? E.g. "birthaim" could return "thai"

* all word lists are expected to be in ASCII but we use String (i.e. UTF-8) throughout
  so it would _probably_ be an optimisation to use bytes instead

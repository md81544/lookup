* Should -f be exact? We could add the % idea as a final wildcard

* Visual flash (or other notification) in -r (interactive remove) as printing a bell character
  won't always work (when a user enters a letter which doesn't exist in the string)

* "Interactive" jumble using crossterm to re-jumble when space
  bar is pressed? 

* Allow -f with -r to find words in "in" clues... for example
  -v aldershotcafedemolition -f __/__c__ should return "de facto"

* List words found as substrings of -g or -r (and maybe a new option to find substring words in a long string? E.g. "birthaim" could return "thai"

* all word lists are expected to be in ASCII but we use String (i.e. UTF-8) throughout
  so it would _probably_ be an optimisation to use bytes instead

* Maybe make use of definitions for thesaurus lookup? E.g. any definition which contains, say, 'horse' in the definition

* Make "cheaty" flags uppercase (or long-form only?)

* % should work after word separator ('/')
    - and also inline, so e.g. s%es could match 'stresses'
      (would need size parameter)

* Add -n/--notepad option for just entering the found letters and the option to edit it to avoid needing an editor sometimes

* Change debug mode to use full dictionary but be verbose (i.e. show workings)

* Interactive mode, where you can just type commands, e.g. "def" for define - could be useful for
  keeping notes too. Maybe implement as a second shell program which calls lookup?

* Positional removal in -f (arrows move cursor around?)

* Visual flash (or other notification) in -r (interactive remove) as printing a bell character
  won't always work (when a user enters a letter which doesn't exist in the string)

* "Interactive" jumble using crossterm to re-jumble when space
  bar is pressed?

* Allow -f with -r to find words in "in" clues... for example
  -v aldershotcafedemolition -f __/__c__ should return "de facto"

* List words found as substrings of -g or -r (and maybe a new option to find substring words in a long string? E.g. "birthaim" could return "thai"

* all word lists are expected to be in ASCII but we use String (i.e. UTF-8) throughout
  so it would _probably_ be an optimisation to use bytes instead

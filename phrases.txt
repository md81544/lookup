it all adds up
it all comes flooding back
it all depends
it beats me
it beggars belief
it bores me to tears
it brings tears to ones eyes
it brings tears to your eyes
it cant be helped
it comes to the same thing
it consultant
it costs a bomb
it could be better
it could be worse
it cuts both ways
it cuts no ice
it cuts no ice with me
it depends
it did the job
it does my head in
it does no harm
it does not add up
it does not matter
it does not signify
it does the trick
it doesnt add up
it doesnt matter
it doesnt really matter
it drives you mad
it fits like a glove
it gets on my wick
it girl
it gives me the creeps
it gladdens the heart
it goes against the grain
it goes down a treat
it goes with the territory
it goes without saying
it happens
it is written
it just doesnt add up
it just goes to show
it just so happens
it keeps cropping up
it literate
it looks like a bombs hit it
it looks like rain
it looks like rain again
it makes a change
it makes my blood boil
it makes my flesh creep
it makes no difference
it makes no odds
it makes no odds to me
it makes no sense
it makes ones blood boil
it makes ones mouth water
it makes you think
it makes you want to weep
it makes you weep
it makes your blood boil
it makes your flesh creep
it makes your mouth water
it makes your skin crawl
it matters not
it matters not one whit
it might never happen
it must be a first
it must be catching
it never entered my head
it never rains but it pours
it pays the bills
it remains to be seen
it rings a bell
it runs in the family
it served its purpose
it serves no useful purpose
it serves you right
it slipped down a treat
it speaks for itself
it speaks to the heart
it stands to reason
it sticks out a mile
it suits me
it suits me down to the ground
it takes all sorts
it takes one to know one
it takes the shine off
it takes time
it takes two
it takes two to tango
it was all go
it was fun while it lasted
it was meant to be
it was not to be
it will all end in tears
it wont be long now
it wont go unnoticed
it wont wash
it works a treat
it works both ways
it would be a brave man

you cant expect miracles
you cant get the staff
you cant go wrong
you cant miss it
you cant take it with you
you cant win
